<h1>Welcome to K News</h1>
<p>
    K Network was founded in May 2002 by Mir Shae. It started out with the launch of its flagship channel K News in October 2002.<br>
    Paul joined the channel and became one of the first journalists to join Geo News. He started hosting the political talk show News Talk <br>
    which is the flagship show of K News. The first guest at the show was George with whom Mir discussed the 2002 general election.<br>
    After K News became a success, the K Network launched a sports channel named K Super in late September 2006.
